    "`G1` and `G2` are described as period one and two grades. In my experience, these features would correspond to trimester one (G1) and trimester two (G2) grades which lead up to the final grade (G3) for the year. These two features —period one and two grades (G1 & G2)— are highly correlated to the responce variable (G3) because they represent the same grading process and performance metric that we are trying to predict. However, there is a powerful binary feature that can be engineered from these two features (G1 & G2) that gets to the source of improved learning perforance, resiliance, and grit; improved grades from period one to period two.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will engineer a new binary feature that is `0` —for students who had grade depreciation or maintained the same grade from period one to period two— or `1` —for students who improved their grade from period one to period two— and use this new feature to perform statistical analysis and machine learning.\n",

    "At this point in feature engineering we have 4 non-numeric features; the mother's job (Mjob), the father's job (Fjob), the reason for attending the school (reason), and the student's guardianship status (guardian).\n",
    "\n",
    "The mother's and father's job seem like significantly large categories ('teacher', 'health' care related, civil 'services', 'at_home' or 'other') and the highest percentage of respondents from both genders responded 'other'. There may be some significance in investigating the statistics for 'at_home' leading to a change in the response varible (G3). This could lead to a binary description of at home parents or working. However, there may be some correlation between the parent job columns and the guardian column. If the guardian column is 'other', then the parents may not be a strong presence within the family unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for choosing the school doesn't naturally lend itself to a binary descriptor. The response choices are, close to 'home', school 'reputation', 'course' preference or 'other'. The hypothesis that I would like to investigate, does a thoughtful decision to attend the school (school 'reputation' or 'course' preference) lead to higher final grades? If we end up rejecting the null hypothesis and except that thoughtfully deciding to attend the school results in significantly higher grades, we can transform this feature to a binary, decided or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "That leaves the guardian status with its input values ('mother', 'father' or 'other'). The hypothesis here would be that any parent guardian —mother or father— results in the same final grade. If we can accept this as true then this feature could also be a binary, parent guardian or not."
