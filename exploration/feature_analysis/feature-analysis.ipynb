    "\n",
    "`G1` and `G2` are described as period one and two grades. In my experience, these features would correspond to trimester one (G1) and trimester two (G2) grades which lead up to the final grade (G3) for the year. These two features —period one and two grades (G1 & G2)— are highly correlated to the responce variable (G3) because they represent the same grading process and performance metric that we are trying to predict. However, there is a powerful binary feature that can be engineered from these two features (G1 & G2) that gets to the source of improved learning perforance, resiliance, and grit; improved grades from period one to period two.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will engineer a new binary feature that is `0` —for students who had grade depreciation or maintained the same grade from period one to period two— or `1` —for students who improved their grade from period one to period two— and use this new feature to perform statistical analysis and machine learning.\n",
